# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-27)

**Core value:** Agents run autonomously without hanging, stay coordinated through contracts and status awareness, and produce integrated code -- all operable from Discord.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — container-foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 2
Plan: Not started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap v2 rev2]: 8 phases (up from 5) for better risk isolation
- [Roadmap v2 rev2]: Supervision tree separated from GsdAgent -- supervision is pure new code, GsdAgent absorbs WorkflowOrchestrator (different risk profiles)
- [Roadmap v2 rev2]: Agent types separated from health tree -- 3 agent types + scheduler in Phase 4, health aggregation in Phase 5
- [Roadmap v2 rev2]: New resilience phase (Phase 6) for RESL-01/02/03 -- rate limiting, outage detection, degraded mode
- [Roadmap v2 rev2]: HLTH-01 (self-reporting) stays in Phase 1 with container base; HLTH-02/03/04 in Phase 5
- [Roadmap v2 rev2]: MIGR-* all in Phase 8 (last) -- v1 MonitorLoop stays as safety net until v2 passes regression tests
- [Phase 01]: Used current_state_value instead of deprecated current_state.id for python-statemachine 3.0.0
- [Phase 01]: CommunicationPort uses typing.Protocol with @runtime_checkable, Message is a dataclass
- [Phase 01]: MemoryStore uses assert for db open guard instead of custom exception
- [Phase 01]: ChildSpecRegistry is plain class (not Pydantic) - dict-based with no validation overhead
- [Phase 01]: Used state_field=_fsm_state to avoid property collision with python-statemachine model binding

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flags Phase 3 (GsdAgent) as highest-risk: map every WorkflowOrchestrator callback before implementation
- Research flags Phase 8 (CompanyRoot wiring) as high integration risk: audit all VcoBot.on_ready() wiring before implementation
- python-statemachine 3.0.x and aiosqlite 0.21.x are new dependencies -- verify versions at implementation time
- 10-minute restart windows (not 60s) needed for slow Claude Code bootstrap -- must configure in Phase 2
